# Breaking-a-Monolithic-Application-into-Microservices-
## Project Overview
This project involves the architectural transformation of a leading global e-commerce platform that offers a diverse range of products to customers worldwide. Originally developed as a monolithic application, the platform integrates key functionalities such as user authentication, product catalog management, order processing, and payment servicesâ€”within a single, tightly coupled codebase.
To enhance scalability, agility, and deployment efficiency, the goal of this project is to refactor the monolithic architecture into a microservices-based architecture. This shift will enable the independent development, deployment, and scaling of each core service, ultimately improving system resilience, team productivity, and time-to-market.
