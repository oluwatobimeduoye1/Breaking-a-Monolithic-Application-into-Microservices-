# Breaking-a-Monolithic-Application-into-Microservices-
## Project Overview
This project involves the architectural transformation of a leading global e-commerce platform that offers a diverse range of products to customers worldwide. Originally developed as a monolithic application, the platform integrates key functionalities such as user authentication, product catalog management, order processing, and payment services within a single, tightly coupled codebase.
To enhance scalability, agility, and deployment efficiency, the goal of this project is to refactor the monolithic architecture into a microservices-based architecture. This shift will enable the independent development, deployment, and scaling of each core service, ultimately improving system resilience, team productivity, and time-to-market. In this project we would leverage AWS Copilot, Amazon ECS, Docker, and AWS Fargate to achieve this.

## Objectives
In this Project, you will deploy a monolithic node.js application to a Docker container, then decouple the application into microservices without any downtime.
The node.js application hosts a simple message board with threads and messages between users.


## Key Concepts
### Importance of Microservices
Traditional monolithic architectures are hard to scale. As an application's code base grows, it becomes complex to update and maintain. Introducing new features, languages, frameworks, and technologies becomes very hard, limiting innovation and new ideas.

Within a microservices architecture, each application component runs as its service and communicates with other services via a well-defined API. Microservices are built around business capabilities, and each service performs a single function. Microservices can be written using different frameworks and programming languages, and you can deploy them independently, as a single service, or as a group of services.

### AWS Copilot
AWS Copilot, a user-friendly command-line interface, streamlines the entire lifecycle of containerized applications, making it easier for developers to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

### Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) provides a scalable and fully managed container orchestration service, offering developers the flexibility to deploy and manage containers effortlessly.

### Docker
Docker, a widely adopted containerization platform, ensures consistency in deployment across diverse environments, promoting seamless collaboration and integration.

### AWs Fargate
As the foundation of this microservices architecture, AWS Fargate enters the scene to abstract away the complexities of infrastructure management. By providing on-demand, serverless compute for containers, Fargate empowers developers to focus solely on their applications without the burden of server provisioning or maintenance.

The integration of AWS Copilot, Amazon ECS, Docker, and AWS Fargate forms a potent alliance, offering organizations the tools needed to successfully break down monolithic barriers, embark on a microservices journey, and unlock the full potential of cloud-native development on the AWS platform. This cohesive ecosystem facilitates a smoother transition and positions businesses to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of digital innovation.
